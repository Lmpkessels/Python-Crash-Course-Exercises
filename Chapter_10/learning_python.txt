Hello, reader! 

For as of today 08-03-2025, I've learned... 

In python you can access files. 
In python you can choose between what types of files you want to create. 
In python you can choose what file is best to use. 
In python it's smart to create a variable and assign the file to it, 
so that, once you type in the variable behind open you access the file. 
In python you can use; when open(here file name) as (what you assign it to). 
then you type a new variable to store the lines within the file. 
In python you can use .text(), .readtext(). To get access to the text within the file. 
In python you can use, For loops to access each line, len to check the lenght, 
slicing to no print all content only as much as you ask for, 
example [:3] now you get only 3 digits. 

It doesn't matter how much a file contains you can access all of it. 

This is what I have learned so far, probably way more, 
but this is for as far as I remember it at the moment. 

Kind regards, 
Luuk Kessels.
